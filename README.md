 This is a small web app around creating a character sheet for a tabletop RPG game like DnD, Pathfinder etc.
 
Character sheets are defined by the following high-level concepts
- Attributes: This represents a character's raw abilities 
- Attribute Modifier: calculated using the related Attribute, this value affects a character's skills
- Skills: A character's ability to perform a specific action
